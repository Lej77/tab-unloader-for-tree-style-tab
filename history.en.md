# History

- master/HEAD
- 6.17 (2024-07-26)
  - Change: rename extension from "Tab Unloader for Tree Style Tab" to "TST Tab Unloader" so that its easier to find in the addons page. ([Issue #42](https://github.com/Lej77/tab-unloader-for-tree-style-tab/issues/42)).
  - Change: more information about showing hidden tabs in Tree Style Tab's sidebar ([Issue #45](https://github.com/Lej77/tab-unloader-for-tree-style-tab/issues/45)).
  - Feature: keyboard shortcut to toggle hiding of unloaded tabs ([Issue #15 for Tree Style Tab in Separate Window](https://github.com/Lej77/tree-style-tab-in-separate-window/issues/15)).
- 6.16 (2024-03-15)
  - Update to `zh` locale by NightSharp. Thanks!
  - Fix: don't try to unload a tab that is in the process of being activated since that can freeze the browser window. This could happen when using a keyboard shortcut multiple times in quick succession in order to unload many tabs. (BugFix in version 6.9 was similar to this one.)
- 6.15 (2022-04-22)
  - Update to `ru` locale by wvxwxvw. Thanks!
- 6.14 (2022-04-17)
  - Feature: options related to unloading "tree descendants" including a new keyboard shortcut and context menu item (all of which are disabled by default).
  - BugFix: wait to prevent Tree Style Tab's default action until we have received all messages from Tree Style Tab that we are interested in for the current mouse click since they might not be sent after preventing the default action. This caused some issues in later versions of Firefox.
- 6.13 (2022-03-12)
  - Settings: improve layout of options page and clarify some things that were confusing.
  - Change: change the default label for the context menu items to use "unload" instead of "suspend" so as to be more consistent with the rest of the extension.
- 6.12 (2022-01-30)
  - Performance: do less logging when unloading tabs via "Auto Tab Discard".
- 6.11 (2022-01-27)
  - BugFix: when using the "Auto Tab Discard" extension to unload tabs it is now possible to unload tabs that it chooses to not handle such as new tabs with the `about:newtab` URL.
- 6.10 (2021-12-20)
  - Performance: improve performance when searching for what tab should be selected when unloading the active tab, especially when unloading many tabs at the same time.
- 6.9 (2021-12-18)
  - BugFix: don't try to select a tab that is in the process of being unloaded since that can freeze the browser window. This could happen when using a keyboard shortcut multiple times in quick succession in order to unload many tabs.
